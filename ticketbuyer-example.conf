### Basic Wallet Configuration ###
##################################
# The wallet account to use to buy tickets. If unset, 
# it is the default account.
accountname=default

# Purchase at most 5 tickets per block. If this is set to 
# negative numbers, the purchaser purchases 1 ticket every
# abs(n) blocks.
maxperblock=5

# Stop buying tickets if the mempool has more than 
# 40 tickets in in.
maxinmempool=40

# Never spend more than 100.0 DCR on a ticket.
maxpriceabsolute=100.0

# Try to leave this many coins remaining in the 
# wallet.
balancetomaintain=500.0

# All purchased tickets will expire in 16 blocks 
# if they fail to exit the mempool and enter the 
# blockchain.

# Give ticket voting rights to this address. Comment 
# this out to use a local address from the wallet it 
# is connect to.

### Price Manipulation and Targeting ###
########################################
# Do not purchase tickets if it will move the difficulty 
# above this multiplier for the 'ideal' ticket price. 
# e.g. if the ideal ticket price is 15.0 DCR, the program 
# will prevent purchasing tickets if it drives the next 
# stake difficulty above 30.0 DCR.
# The 'ideal' ticket price is calculated with every new 
# block as (VWAP + ticketPoolAvgValue)/2.
maxpricescale=2.0

# Force the wallet to purchase tickets if the price 
# is estimated to fall below this proportional amount 
# of the 'ideal' ticket price. This prevents the stake 
# difficulty from falling too low.
# e.g. if the ideal ticket price is 15.0 DCR, the program 
# will force the purchasing tickets if it detects that 
# the next stake difficulty will be below 10.5 DCR.
minpricescale=0.7

# The wallet normally targets the purchase of tickets 
# to meet the average price of the market. A wallet 
# with a large amount of DCR may wish to push the 
# price of tickets higher. e.g. if the current 
# average price of a ticket is 15 DCR, the user may 
# think that tickets are too cheap and wants to 
# move the average to 18 DCR. The user would then 
# set this value to 18 DCR.
# A value of 0.0 disables this feature, and it is 
# recommended to be left disabled unless you think 
# you have enough DCR to be able to strongly move 
# the average price.
pricetarget=0.0

# Determine the average price of the ticket using any 
# of the following methods:
#   pool: use the average price in the ticket pool
#   vwap: use the volume weighted average price
#   dual: use the average of both the pool and VWAP
# 
# Default: vwap
avgpricemode=vwap

# The number of blocks from the current chain tip 
# to use in the calculation of the ticket volume 
# weighted average price. The default is 2880, or 
# 10 days on mainnet.
avgpricevwapdelta=2880

### Ticket and Transaction Fees ###
###################################
# The maximum allowable fee in a competitive market 
# for tickets is 1.00 DCR/KB.
# Note that by default, the maximum the wallet will 
# allow you to set is 1.00 DCR/KB. You can allow 
# higher fees by turning on the --allowhighfees flag 
# when starting wallet.
maxfee=1.00

# The minimum allowable fee in a competitive market 
# for tickets is 0.01 DCR/KB.
minfee=0.01

# Use the mean of block or difficulty window periods 
# to determine the fees to use in your tickets.
# Alternatively the median may be used with 'median'.
feesource=mean

# The proportion to use above the mean/median for 
# your tickets. e.g. If the network mean for the 
# last 11 blocks is 0.10, use 105%*0.10 = 0.105 
# DCR/KB as your ticket fee.
feetargetscaling=1.05

# Set the transaction fees to 0.01 DCR/KB. This fee is 
# used when generating consolidations of smaller UTXOs 
# that are immediately consumed by a ticket purchase.
txfee=0.01

# The number of previous blocks to average to calculate 
# what fees to use. If there are not enough blocks in 
# this window yet, the software will scan old difficulty 
# periods for the one with the price closest to the 
# current price and use the average fees from that 
# period for deciding what fee to use.
blockstoavg=11
