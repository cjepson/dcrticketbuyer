## Enable the HTTP monitoring server bound to localhost,
## port 7770. Access in browser with:
##   http://localhost:7770
## The optional parameter httpsvrbind allows you to 
## bind the server externally or to another IP.
httpsvrport=7770

## The path to store monitoring logs in along with all 
## the libraries/data for the HTTP server. This folder 
## must constain the JavaScript libraries d3 and dimple 
## for this to function correctly.
## By default, the path is "webui/" in PWD.
httpuipath=webui/

## Enable testnet. Set to false to use mainnet. Can not 
## be used with simnet.
testnet=true

## Enable simnet. Can not be used with testnet.
simnet=false

### Basic Wallet Configuration ###
##################################
## The wallet account to use to buy tickets. If unset, 
## it is the default account.
#
# accountname=default

## Purchase at most 5 tickets per block. If this is set to 
## negative numbers, the purchaser purchases 1 ticket every
## abs(n) blocks.
#
# maxperblock=5

## Stop buying tickets if the mempool has more than 
## 40 tickets in in.
#
# maxinmempool=40

## Never spend more than 100.0 DCR on a ticket.
#
# maxpriceabsolute=100.0

## Try to leave this many coins remaining in the 
## wallet.
#
# balancetomaintain=500.0

## All purchased tickets will expire in 16 blocks 
## if they fail to exit the mempool and enter the 
## blockchain.
#
# expirydelta=16

## Give ticket voting rights to this address. If 
## no address is entered, voting rights go to the 
## wallet that is purchasing the tickets.
#
# ticketaddress=TsfjLsBv6aKQoLmfPJUn3w6r6AB2JajoMrW

## Enable pool ticket purchase mode and send 1.23% 
## pool fees to this address. If this is commented 
## out, pool mode is disabled.
#
# pooladdress=TsYxLCKr7qtsDxYaJ32zAQg3rFao6aGAHXh
# poolfees=1.23

########################################
### Price Manipulation and Targeting ###
########################################
## Do not purchase tickets if it will move the difficulty 
## above this multiplier for the 'ideal' ticket price. 
## e.g. if the ideal ticket price is 15.0 DCR, the program 
## will prevent purchasing tickets if it drives the next 
## stake difficulty above 30.0 DCR.
## The 'ideal' ticket price is calculated with every new 
## block as (VWAP + ticketPoolAvgValue)/2.
#
# maxpricescale=2.0

## Force the wallet to purchase tickets if the price 
## is estimated to fall below this proportional amount 
## of the 'ideal' ticket price. This prevents the stake 
## difficulty from falling too low.
## e.g. if the ideal ticket price is 15.0 DCR, the program 
## will force the purchasing tickets if it detects that 
## the next stake difficulty will be below 10.5 DCR.
#
# minpricescale=0.7

## The wallet normally targets the purchase of tickets 
## to meet the average price of the market. A wallet 
## with a large amount of DCR may wish to push the 
## price of tickets higher. e.g. if the current 
## average price of a ticket is 15 DCR, the user may 
## think that tickets are too cheap and wants to 
## move the average to 18 DCR. The user would then 
## set this value to 18 DCR.
## A value of 0.0 disables this feature, and it is 
## recommended to be left disabled unless you think 
## you have enough DCR to be able to strongly move 
## the average price.
#
# pricetarget=0.0

## Determine the average price of the ticket using any 
## of the following methods:
##   pool: use the average price in the ticket pool
##   vwap: use the volume weighted average price
##   dual: use the average of both the pool and VWAP
## 
## Default: vwap
#
# avgpricemode=vwap

## The number of blocks from the current chain tip 
## to use in the calculation of the ticket volume 
## weighted average price. The default is 2880, or 
## 10 days on mainnet.
#
# avgpricevwapdelta=2880

### Ticket and Transaction Fees ###
###################################
## The maximum allowable fee in a competitive market 
## for tickets is 1.00 DCR/KB.
## Note that by default, the maximum the wallet will 
## allow you to set is 1.00 DCR/KB. You can allow 
## higher fees by turning on the --allowhighfees flag 
## when starting wallet.
#
# maxfee=1.00

## The minimum allowable fee in a competitive market 
## for tickets is 0.01 DCR/KB.
#
# minfee=0.01

## Use the mean of block or difficulty window periods 
## to determine the fees to use in your tickets.
## Alternatively the median may be used with 'median'.
#
# feesource=mean

## The proportion to use above the mean/median for 
## your tickets. e.g. If the network mean for the 
## last 11 blocks is 0.10, use 105%*0.10 = 0.105 
## DCR/KB as your ticket fee.
#
# feetargetscaling=1.05

## Set the transaction fees to 0.01 DCR/KB. This fee is 
## used when generating consolidations of smaller UTXOs 
## that are immediately consumed by a ticket purchase.
#
# txfee=0.01

## The number of previous blocks to average to calculate 
## what fees to use. If there are not enough blocks in 
## this window yet, the software will scan old difficulty 
## periods for the one with the price closest to the 
## current price and use the average fees from that 
## period for deciding what fee to use.
#
# blockstoavg=11
