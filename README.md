(https://travis-ci.org/cjepson/dcrticketbuyer)

dcrticketbuyer is a smart ticket purchasing bot for the automatic purchase 
of tickets from a Decred wallet. It uses both the daemon and wallet RPC 
to collect data on the blockchain and mempool and use that to make decisions 
about buying tickets.

This project is currently under active development and is in an alpha state.

## Requirements

[Go](http://golang.org) 1.5 or newer.

## Installation

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

- Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

NOTE: The `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` above must not be the same path.  It is
recommended that `GOPATH` is set to a directory in your home directory such as
`~/goprojects` to avoid write permission issues.

- Run the following command to obtain dcrticketbuyer, all dependencies, and 
install it:

```bash
$ go get -u -v github.com/cjepson/dcrticketbuyer/...
```

- dcrticketbuyer (and utilities) will now be installed in either 
  ```$GOROOT/bin``` or ```$GOPATH/bin``` depending on your configuration.  If 
  you did not already add the bin directory to your system path during Go 
  installation, we recommend you do so now.

## Updating

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Run the following command to update btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ go get -u -v github.com/cjepson/dcrticketbuyer/...
```

## Getting Started

dcrticketbuyer has several configuration options avilable to tweak how it

configuration file that specifies exactly the type of behavior they would 
prefer for ticket purchase. For reference, these options are given below.

#### Linux/BSD/POSIX/Source

It is recommended to use a configuration file to fine tune the software. A 
sample configuration file is give below, with explanations about what the 
software will do.

```
# Enable testnet.
testnet=true

# Purchase at most 5 tickets per block.
maxperblock=5

# Stop buying tickets if the mempool has more than 
# 40 tickets in in.
maxinmempool=40

# Never spend more than 100.0 DCR on a ticket.
maxpriceabsolute=100.0

# Do not purchase tickets if it will move the difficulty 
# above this multiplier for the 'ideal' ticket price. 
# e.g. if the ideal ticket price is 15.0 DCR, the program 
# will prevent purchasing tickets if it drives the next 
# stake difficulty above 30.0 DCR.
# The 'ideal' ticket price is calculated with every new 
# block as (VWAP + ticketPoolAvgValue)/2.
maxpricescale=2.0

# Force the wallet to purchase tickets if the price 
# is estimated to fall below this proportional amount 
# of the 'ideal' ticket price. This prevents the stake 
# difficulty from falling too low.
# e.g. if the ideal ticket price is 15.0 DCR, the program 
# will force the purchasing tickets if it detects that 
# the next stake difficulty will be below 10.5 DCR.
minpricescale=0.7

# The wallet normally targets the purchase of tickets 
# to meet the average price of the market. A wallet 
# with a large amount of DCR may wish to push the 
# price of tickets higher. e.g. if the current 
# average price of a ticket is 15 DCR, the user may 
# think that tickets are too cheap and wants to 
# move the average to 18 DCR. The user would then 
# set this value to 18 DCR.
# A value of 0.0 disables this feature, and it is 
# recommended to be left disabled unless you think 
# you have enough DCR to be able to strongly move 
# the average price.
pricetarget=0.0

# The maximum allowable fee in a competitive market 
# for tickets is 1.00 DCR/KB.
maxfee=1.00

# The minimum allowable fee in a competitive market 
# for tickets is 0.01 DCR/KB.
minfee=0.01

# Use the mean of block or difficulty window periods 
# to determine the fees to use in your tickets.
# Alternatively the median may be used with 'median'.
feesource=mean

# The proportion to use above the mean/median for 
# your tickets. e.g. If the network mean for the 
# last 11 blocks is 0.10, use 105%*0.10 = 0.105 
# DCR/KB as your ticket fee.
feetargetscaling=1.05

# Try to leave this much coins remaining in the 
# wallet.
balancetomaintain=500.0

# Give ticket voting rights to this address.
ticketaddress=TsfjLsBv6aKQoLmfPJUn3w6r6AB2JajoMrW

# Send 1.23% pool fees to this address.
pooladdress=TsYxLCKr7qtsDxYaJ32zAQg3rFao6aGAHXh
poolfees=1.23

# Set the transaction fees to 0.00001 DCR/KB.
txfee=0.00001

# All purchased tickets will expire in 16 blocks 
# if they fail to exit the mempool and enter the 
# blockchain.
expirydelta=16
```

The program may then be run with

```bash
$ dcrtickeybuyer -C ticketbuyer.conf
```
